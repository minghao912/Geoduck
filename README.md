A web application to convert between Chinese Simplified and Chinese Traditional. Might add support for Japanese 旧字体 and 新字体 in the future.

This repository contains both the server-side node.js code and client-side browser code.
The server handles GET requests to certain URLs in form "/direction?query=abc" and responds with the converted output as a JSON.
